# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project builds a supervised machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. It handles class imbalance with class-weighted learning and compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and HistGradientBoosting. Random Forest performs best.
